 <h1 style="text-align: center;" class="service-text"><b> Our Nature Services</b></h1>  
 <h1 class="font-p"><b>Business Services</b></h1> 
 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="service-p" >Business services are the services used by businesses to conduct their business activities. For example, banking, insurance, transportation, warehousing and communication services.
    Today, businesses are relying on specialized business services more than ever.</p>
 <h1 class="font-p"><b>Social Services</b></h1>
 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="service-p" >Social services are those services that are generally provided voluntarily in pursuit of certain social goals.
        These social goals may be to improve the standard of living for weaker sections of society, to provide educational services to their children, or to provide health care and hygienic conditions in slum areas.
        These services are usually provided voluntarily but for some consideration to cover their costs. For example, health care and education services provided by certain Non-government organisations (NGOs) and government agencies .</p>
 <h1 class="font-p"><b>Personal Services</b></h1>
 <p style="text-align: justify;" class="service-p" >Personal services are those services which are experienced differently by different customers.
    These services cannot be consistent in nature.
    They will differ depending upon the service provider.
    They will also depend upon customers preferences and demands. For example, tourism, recreational services, restaurants.</p>
